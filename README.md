# Q method study on gene editing in agriculture

This repository includes (anonymized) data and code used to conduct a Q method study, which formed a chapter of my PhD thesis as well as a manuscript currently 
under review. Data collection for the study involved (1) Two ~10 person focus groups, which were transcribed, coded and used to generate a Q method "concourse", 
(2) 20 structured "Q" interviews. For reasons of confidentiality, this repository contains only the data and code used in part 2 of the study. Analysis of the Q interviews was facilitated by the use of the [Q method package](http://aiorazabala.github.io/qmethod/) for R. 

This study asked: amongst young urban professionals, do views on gene editing and gene drives in agriculture follow patterns? Do they group in specific ways? How
do views on various applications with different specifics compare?
